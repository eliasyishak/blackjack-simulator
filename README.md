To run the simulation, navigate to the `src/main.py` file and execute
the python script. The seed and number of games has already been set by
default, but if you wish to change them, you are free to  do so by changing
the following variables `GAMES`.

Once the simulation has ended, you will find the output in the `out/results.xlsx`
file in the root folder.

Note, you will need to pip install all of the required dependencies that
have been included in the `requirements.txt`. I recommend using a virtual
environment so there won't be any conflicts with already existing python
packages.

Run the simulation with the following command for python3

```
<!-- Run from the root folder -->
python3 src/main.py
```

An example python script can be found in `example/example.py` that serves
as an interactive approach to the simulation, good luck :)
